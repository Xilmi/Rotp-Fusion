## What's New

26-05-18
- New Options: Max Range Tech Gap & Max Warp Tech Gap
  - It's always frustrating when no engine technologies or no fuel technologies are available for research... These options ensure that at least some of these technologies are included in the technology tree.

26-05-15
- Fixed an issue with large maps where a star system could be placed too close to Orion.
- Fixed annoying "Null Pointer Exception" in Auto Resolve.
  - They were already trapped by ae "Try - Catch", but this was very annoying when debugging, with a break point on "Null Pointer Exception".
