- The AI will now shoot missiles at planets as soon as possible, missiles at ships as soon as possible when it has more than 2 remaining volleys and otherwise first come close enough to guarantee missiles will hit even if the opponent tries to dodge them.
- The reduction in score for choosing a target that already has incoming missiles will only occur if the incoming missiles will destroy at least one unit in the stack. Otherwise the aforementioned splitting by missile-rack can lead to distributing damage to several stacks but killing nothing.

- Instead of having a weird inconsistent handling for missile-ships with still flying missiles, the incoming missiles are now taken into consideration directly in the method that determines which side is expected to win. So AI decsion-making about when to retreat should now be a lot smarter in situations that involve active missile-stacks.

2023.05.19 (BR)
- Moved games options from UserPreferences to IGameOptions to be available through options() call.

  - They are distributed on several files for a better lisibility. (No need to flood IGameOptions)
- Added "noOptions" in Rotp to validate the end of options initialisation... Early call to options are fatal!
- Fixed Missiles not reaching planet.
  - It was a bug that has probably always been there! The distance to unlock the fire button was calculated according to ship movement rules (Diagonal movement = 1). But missiles follow another rule! (Diagonal movement = sqrt(2)). When ships are on the side of the screen, their distance to the planet is 6, but for missiles, this distance is ~7.2. Since the merculite missile range is 6 (+0.7 attack range)... You were allowed to fire, but the missiles run out of fuel before reaching the target and are destroyed!

  - Fixed an issue that prevented you from switching off ship-building when the governor was enabled on planets that were captured while building ships. Thanks again to /u/Mjoelnir77 for reporting.

2022.10.04 (Xilmi)
  - Halfed the numner of systems for the biggest possible map-size. I wanted to do more trial&error to see what the biggest is that I could go but I couldn't be bothered to sit another several minutes through galaxy-creation-time.
  - Fixed polish translation of Deuterium Fuel Cells to be the same as the translation of Iridium Fuel Cells.
  - Colonies now always produce at least 0.1 income in order to prevent weird effects resulting from zero or negative income. This fixes an exploit reported by /u/Mjoelnir77

2022.10.03 (Xilmi)
  - Reduced the amount of animation-frames for shooting weapons and displaying weapon-effects when using auto-combat to speed it up significantly.
  - Reduced the amount of animation-frames for bio-weapons to the same number as for regular bombs.
  - The expansion-tab on the systems-screen now also provides information on fertility, mineral-richness and artifacts.
  - The exploit-tab on the systems-screen now also provides information on planet-type and size.
  - In autoplay-mode the personality and objective of your AI's leader is now visible in the diplomacy-tab of the races-screen.
  - Fixed that "Hybrid" was missing from the autoplay-options.
  - The order of "Fun" and "Character" in the menu have been swapped to indicate that "Character" is likely the easier of both options.
  - "Character" is the new default-AI-mode for now as I want to gather more feedback on it's changes and I think this increases the chance of people using that mode.
  - Fusion-AI will now ask others if they would start a joint war on their preferred target even if they are not already at war with their preferred target.
  - Fusion-AI will now agree to starting a joint war, if someone asks them to attack their preferred target together even if they wouldn't have done so on their own.
  - The AI-Mode "Character" has been reworked tremendously. The personality and objective of each leader should now have significant impact on how they behave.
    This impacts tech-slider-allocation-preferences, the choice who, if anyone is preferred as war target and how likely a war-declaration on their target is.
    Each objective type prefers a certain tech-category in the way, that they act as if all techs in that category cost only half of the regular price.
    Technologist => Computers, Industrialist => Construction, Diplomat => Force-Fields, Ecologist => Planetology, Expansionist => Propulsion, Militarist => Weapons
    Choice of favorite war-target now works as follows:
    Militarist => Their military-industrial-complex needs to justify itself and infuences the decisions of their leader. And the best justification is to have a strong enemy. They will always pick the opponent with the strongest military.
    Industrialist => Protecting their existing industry takes precedent over anything else. They will pick whoever is the owner of the colony that is closest to their core-worlds.
    Ecologist => Their main-interest is to keep the ecology of the galaxy as balanced as possible. They want to regulate species that have grown out of control and will always target whoever has the highest population. If that is themselves, they see no reason for war and will not attack anyone as war is not particularly great for the eco-systems of the planets either.
    Technologist => They want the techs. All of them. If you have techs, that they don't have you move onto their target-list. The higher the levels of these techs the higher you move up on their "to take techs from by force"-list. If they have everything everyone else has, they are completely content and won't attack anyone.
    Expansionist => They want more planets. Regardless of how many they already have. They want them quick and they don't want to make this goal hard for themselves. They attack in a similar pattern as the Industrialist. Except they look at what planet is closest to their core-fleet and they also take into account how much resistance they expect from their target.
    Diplomat => They are the most cunning of the bunch. They use a complex algorithm that takes a lot of things into account. In particular what the relationship of other races with each other looks like. They are very likely to pick on the ones who are already struggling.
    Personality impacts whether and when wars are declared and whether and when peace is considered. They impact the behavior as follows:
    Important note: None of the following is true, when there's only 2 factions left. In this case, all of them will always immediately attack.
    Ruthless => They will definitely attack their preferred target and chase it down until there's nothing left to attack. They don't care about their own losses and will only ever agree to peace when they are very close to extinction.
    Aggressive => They will attack even if they are at somewhat of a disadvantage. But they are not suicidal. They will make peace if things are looking badly or when they are eying another target.
    Xenophobic => They are cautious and opportunistic. They only attack when they see themselves at an advantage. They will make peace if things are looking badly or when they are eying another target.
    Erratic => On average they are just like the Xenophobes... But sometimes they are as aggressive as an aggressive one... other times they are quite timid and skittish. But the average is of little help, when they still declare war eventually. They will make peace if things are looking badly or when they are eying another target.
    Pacifist => They are actually real pacifists and don't want to have anyhting to do with war. They never start wars on their own. They will want to make peace as soon as the situation has changes. Regardless in what direction. Even if they are winning. Except when they still have transports en-route, that is!
    Honorable => They won't start a war unless someone asks them too. If they are asked to attack the target they are eyeing, they will declare war. They won't do surprise-attacks and always warn their target in advance. However, once they have commited to a war, they will not back down from it. There is no honour in backing down!
    Note, that the competitive strength of these personalities varies dramatically as I deliberately chose not to care about balancing them at all. All that was important to me for this AI-type is to make them play their roles in an immersive way!
    So while a Xenophobic Diplomat will naturally make smart decisions suitable for winning, whereas a Honorable Militarist might let themselves be dragged into a war with an opponent that will eventually just kill them.

2022.09.30 (Xilmi)
  - Shooting beam-weapons should now look much more like how it looked in Master of Orion.

2022.09.28 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a bug reported by /u/Thor1Noak where the robotics-control-bonus of the Meklonar was not being taken into consideration for calculating how many alien factories could be converted within one turn and thus lead to neither building nor converting any factories at all.

2022.09.27 (Xilmi)
  - AI follows a more adaptive research-strategy in the expansion phase.
  - Fixed an issue where in certain cases the AI accidentally knew whether a system was colonized or not when it shouldn't be able to know it.
  - Fixed an issue where the governor wouldn't realize that planets became colonizable after the event that turns uncolonizable planets into colonizable ones.
  - Reworked diplomatic decision-making of Fusion-AI. It should be a lot more aggressive and also try to stop empires that are getting too strong.

2022.09.21 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a crash reportet by /u/Thor1Noak that could occur when the AI wanted to check the range of their current colonizer during diplomatic negotiations, while only having a huge colonizer-design but now no longer wanting a huge design for colonizers but hasn't had the chance to design a new non-huge colony-ship yet because diplomacy is processed before ship-designing!
  - Changed e-mail-address for the bug-report-prompt to my own.

2022.09.20 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a rare issue that could cause the governor to forget it was supposed to be building ships.
  - Fixed that the bombardment-preview would display too high of a kill-count when the attack-level exceeded 10.
  - AI no longer tries to reinvade rebelling colonies when they are under siege by their enemies.
  - AI now uses actual travel-turns for the scoring of where to send their ships. Previously this was extrapolated by distance:speed with a modifier for nebulae. This change likely will increase AI-processing-time on big maps but should help the AI to make better decisions when nebulae are involved.

2022.09.18 (Xilmi)
  - Removed AI: Unfair and added two new AI's instead: AI: Fun and AI: Character. The diplomatic behaviour of AI: Fusion has also been reworked.
  - AI: Fusion: While the race still has some impact on aggression-level, it is now significantly less aggressive for all races and more about playing safe.
  - AI: Character is roughly similar to how Fusion-AI used to work a while back and takes leader-personality into account for how aggressive it should be. Pick this option for getting the experience clostest to how it played before this update.
  - AI: Fun is meant to provide a fun challenge with comparable difficulty across different playthroughs rather than having extreme variance from one game to another. I don't want to spoil yet how exactly it works as I want some unbiased feedback. But I promise that it neither cheats nor is aware of the player to do so. This is now also the default for new games.
  - Random-options for AI have been changed accordingly. Instead of "Random" and "Random+" there now are:
  - AI: Random - Chooses a random AI out of all other AIs.
  - AI: R.Basic - Randomly chooses one of Base, Modnar or Rookie.
  - AI: R.Xilmi - Randomly chooses one of Roleplay, Hybrid, Fun, Character or Fusion.
  - AI: R.no relat - Randomly chooses on of the AIs that don't use relationship for decision-making, which are: Fun, Character and Fusion.
  - The impact of tech-level to both the power-graph and AI's consideration of other's power is now linked to how miniaturization works. This means getting new techs in early-game will have a much lower impact on the power-graph.
  - Fixed an issue that didn't take how far the mouse's scrolling wheel was spun into consideration of how far to scroll in load-game-screen. This issue exists at many places throughout the game that all need fixing. But fixing it for loading-screen was most important due to how much of a nuisance it was to scroll down to a turn-1 save if you have a lot of auto-saves.
  - Fixed that altering build-limit would only call governor when altered from colonies-screen.
  - Fixed governor overspending in ecology under certain circumstances.
  - AI now takes initiative into account when considering whether a speed-disadvantge will lead to dealing less damage.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented AI from attacking the Orion-guardian.

2022.09.13 (Xilmi)
  - Changed that after finishing a predefined amount of ships or a stargate the allocations weren't changed back automatically from ships to something else.
  - When you change the build-limit the governor is called and will immediately start building the ordered ships given it doesn't need all of it's allocation to build something else.
  - Having a build-limit set now will also tell the governor that it's colony is supposed to be building ships. In this case it doesn't need a tick in ship-allocation to remember that.
  - Governor will now spend the exact amount of money required into building the ships requested via build-limit instead of keeping the bar at a maximum.
  - Fixed an issue with tech-tree-generation when "Always" was chosen in "MOD Options B" for certain techs that could cause the available techs to be empty for certain tiers and thus made the category unresearchable.
  - When the opponent has a warp-dissipator, AI will not try to retreat their last ship at the last moment anymore and instead at the first moment it thinks it'll lose.
  - AI now will want to upgrade trade-treaties when the trade-volume is more than 1.5 than that of the last treaty or the treaty is maxed out instead of requiring both of these conditions to be met.

2022.09.12 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed issue introduced in last version that prevented the governor from building defensive structures.

2022.09.11 (Xilmi)
  - The player is now informed when a stargate is finished even if it was built using governor.
  - When the governor is active and the player is informed about being able to change allocations the part that readjused allocations on it's own differently from how the governor would have behaved is no longer executed.
  - The "Equalize Allocations"-button in the Tech-screen now uses a more equal algorithm for it's equalization.
  - Instead of using a cost-based fleet-power analysis the AI now uses one based on firepower and defensive stats. This should lead to more accurate assumptions about whether a fleet will be able to deal with their enemies. This will help the Fiershan and Altairi in particular as their bonuses are now correctly taken into consideration during this analyis.
  - Ship-design-screen and Military-tab in the race-screen now include racial-bonuses for attack and defense for the displayed ship-design-stats.
  - Fixed many bugs in AI-fleet behavior. Most of those caused by the revamp of using a fleet-power-based analysis but certainly also some that existed before. Keep an eye open for remaining unintentional behaviors, though!
  - Fixed issue causing AI not attacking space-monsters like the Guardian in space-combat.
  - Fixed issue where finishing a research-category would not automatically redistribute the allocation-points that were freed up by this.
  - Fixed issue that prevent you from using the governor to build ships in the same turn a stargate got finished.
  - Fixed a nested call of the governor that could lead to weird, unintentional slider-allocations.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that could lead to not putting remaining allocation into either ships or research.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that caused it to put an additional click into ship-building instead of only when it was meant to memorize that it was building ships before. This sometimes could lead to pollution.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that could lead it to put more allocation into ecology, industry or ship than was needed to finish the current project.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that could lead to allocating more production than it actually had available when building a stargate.
  - Fixed that you could change the allocation of the eco-slider when it was locked by using the max-slider-button.
  - Fixed that after maxing the eco-slider the function that makes sure that it's clean was called as that could lead to the slider not actually being maxed.
  - Fixed that when using the max-slider-buttons from inside of the Colonies-screen the sliders wouldn't properly update.

2022.09.09 (BR)
  - Moved restart button to the left side, to be visible in windowed mode too.

2022.09.09 (Xilmi)
  - The bombardment-prompt now includes an estimate of how many factories will be destroyed.
  - AI no longer assumes that producing population to man all already existing factories is always worth it. Instead the return of investment of workers working factories is compared to the savings of letting population grow naturally.
  - AI cost-benefit-analysis for invasions now takes lost-productivity into account on the cost-side and how many factories will likely be destroyed until the invasion arrives on the benefit-side.

2022.09.08 (BR)
  - Fixed restart issue for late game when an empire as lost his home world.

2022.09.06 (BR)

2022.09.05 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed width-issue in races-screen and replaced short text describing racial abilities with a more prominent hint to click the text to get full information about a species' abilities.
  - Autodesign as well as AI now try to fill up the design better when there's still some space left.
  - Some refactoring considering the Roleplay-AI. Roleplay-AI now uses the same AI-General as Fusion-AI. This shall bring some lacking aspects of it's play to Fusion-AI's level. All important distinctions are in it's AI-Diplomat.

2022.09.04 (Xilmi)
  - Introduced new AI-type: Hybrid. Hybrid-AI is based on Fusion-AI but uses the same Diplomacy- and Espionage-logic as Rookie-AI.
  - Planets initially spawned as fertile were lacking the associated size-increase. This is fixed now.
  - Fixed that confirming a design after using Auto would change the icon of the design.
  - Fixed that Incidents meant exclusively for the Roleplay-AI were also taken into consideration by other AI-types.
  - Fusion-AI will now retreat from enemy colonies it can't do damage to even if their fleet would survive aswell. This is to prevent useless losses if one stack has auto-repair but the colony would target another other.

2022.09.03 (BR)
  - Restart: Fixed nearby system order; Not important to the player, but the AI was fooled.
  - Restart: Fixed Swapped opponent randomly generated.

2022.09.02 (BR)
  - Restart: You can now choose the empire.
  - Custom Races Menu: Fixed ground attack cost.

2022.09.01 (Xilmi)
  - Both trade-partners now gain faster trade-route-growth if one of them has a diplomacy-bonus.
  - Auto-ship-design now recognizes the role of the previous design in that slot and will create a design fulfilling that same role.
  - Fixed an issue that caused AI being able to research Future-Tech before it had all other techs in the respective category.
  - Fusion-AI less willing to resort to designs with almost no bombs when fighting multi-frontier-wars.
  - Removed a condition that could lead to Fusion-AI not to build colony-ships.
  - A bunch of improvements of how Fusion-AI reacts to their opponents building many missile-bases.

2022.08.31 (BR)
  - Diplomacy panel: Added show all abilities by clicking on "Ability".
  - Removed the values of the planet type.

2022.08.30 (BR)

  - Ranamed CustomRace to CustomRaceFactory to match the naming philosophy.

2022.08.28 (Xilmi)
  - The growth-speed of trade routes has been normalized and is no longer affected by how much one empire likes the other.
  - The racial diplomacy-bonus now impacts trade-route-growth-speed.
  - Removed an unintentional way of Fusion-AI rejecting peace-treaties.
  - Fixed an issue where the AI considered bio-weapons to always do no damage when there was at least one missile base on the strategical map. This makes them way stronger in mid-game-bio-weapon-elimination-wars.
  - Fixed an issue where the AI would always try and sometimes fail to find an alternative target for a fleet too small take on an enemy siege-fleet. This issue was especially problematic when they were outranged. And this fix should make the AI much better at defending.
  - During war AI will only use their own colonies as gatherpoints.

2022.08.27 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue causing Modnar- and Rookie-AI to be replaced by Roleplay-AI.
  - The starting ship-designs for Fighter, Bomber and Destroyer are now procedurally generated to make sure they work correctly with Neo-Humans and custom-races that change the space on their ships.
  - There now is an Auto-button on the ship-design-screen that will automatically generate a design for the selected size.
  - Fixed an issue that could cause missile-boats to be designed with sizes that weren't intended for missile-boats.
  - Further improved invasion-logic of Fusion-AI.
  - Fusion-AI will now adapt the usage of shields depending on how many of the systems they can reach are in nebulae.
  - Fusion-AI now uses a more optimistic logic to determine whether its fleets should be able to handle enemy missile-bases during decision-making where to send their fleets.
  - Fusion-AI will no longer retreat defending ships when they are the last stack other than their planet and the missile-bases would beat the opponent all alone.
  - Fusion-AI will no longer consider personality to determine how aggressive it should be. However, there is now a bigger variance in how the race impacts aggressivness. This also means the extremes of extremely aggressive and extremely passive have been removed and everyone is within a range of 67-150% of the default. Note that for now all custom-races played by the AI will use default-aggressivenes instead of something appropriate to their modifiers.

2022.08.27 (BR)

  - Fixed an issue that could cause AI to bomb when it shouldn't and not bomb when it should.
  - The amount of ships that cover for an incoming invasion of an enemy planet will be reduced in some cases.
  - You can now create rally-points by right-clicking a system while having another system selected. This will also shift all rallies going towards the selected system to the right-clicked system. This is a fast and convenient way to quickly reorganize rally-points.

2022.08.17 (Xilmi)
  - The scout-fix from yesterdays version could cause AI to spam lots of colony-ships. This has been fixed.

2022.08.16 (Xilmi)
  - You can now review each races' ability in the diplomacy-tab in the races-screen
  - AI will now continue to use already existing scout-designs when it doesn't want scouts anymore rather than having them idle until they are scrapped (primarily impacts NeoHumans)
  - When the AI designs ships where the primary weapon is 2-shot-missiles it will not use shields or defensive specials at the same time in favor of more fire-power

2022.08.15 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue where AI would consider potential enemy missile-bases as more dangerous than they actually are during invasion-calculations

  - Improved selection of systems where Fusion-AI builds colony-ships to allow faster expansion
  - Fusion-AI will now avoid attacking undefended planets in tactical-combat when it would destroy a colony it still wants to invade
  - Fixed issue where Fusion-AI would sometimes bombard planets it shouldn't bombard
  - Fusion-AI invasion-logic is now completely driven by cost-benefit analysis including the troops expected to be shot down
  - Fusion-AI no longer refitting factories when there's an urgent threat like an invasion or a siege
