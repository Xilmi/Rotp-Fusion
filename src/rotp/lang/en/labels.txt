MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | My lord, our scouts stand at the ready to discover a new world for our colony ship to bring into the fold so that we may add the territory to our illustrious sovereignty. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | A new world bears our banner, but it grows at an inhibited rate. Sending a transport to the colony will enable it to grow at a much swifter rate.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | Another spacefaring civilization has revealed itself! Our diplomats will observe all appropriate decorum in your name, and take careful note on if they respond in kind.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | Our greatest minds have crafted a new, more efficient engine design. They wish for you to review existing ship schematics and decide how best to apply the new engines to our fleets.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | Our era of peace cannot continue while an undignified species wages war on our glorious empire. The people of the Empire stand united under you, and will assemble their fleets to wherever you direct them.
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | With the sovereign fleets engaged in battle, our outer worlds lie vulnerable to enemy aggression. We can begin our construction of defensive missile bases on any world you desire.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | Our researchers have had a breakthrough in regards to ship weaponry. The fleets can be outfitted with these devastating pieces of technology at any time.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | The Galactic Council will soon convene, and our presence will no doubt be highly desired. Our diplomats will take this chance to ensure all that is decided upon will further the good of the sovereignty. 
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | Ah, a rebellion on %1. How quaint. I suppose it was bound to happen at some point my lord, but we should still bring it to heel before discontent spreads to our other colonies.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | My lord! We stand with you! There shall be no peace in this galaxy until you take your rightful place upon its highest throne! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Pathetic. See how the fools struggle against the inevitable? Give us the order to crush these rebels, and we shall see it done!

Attack-size scales with difficulty.<br> An important bug about retreat-behavior is fixed. There's no real point in having the two other base-AIs around. It's just so the Mod doesn't lack them as a feature.
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_ROOKIE          | AI: Rookie
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_XILMI_HELP      | AI-Family: Xilmi<br> Uses a diplomacy-module that is similar to that of the Base-Family in the sense that it uses relationship-values for decision-making. However, it also differs from these in that there's no dice-rolling involved and instead thresholds for NAPs and Alliances dynamically adjust based on a power-comparison. Basically: The weaker an AI is compared to others, the more willing it is to sign alliances even when the relationship isn't great. Based on personality alliances can be a lot more stable.
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_XILMI           | AI: Roleplay
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_HYBRID_HELP     | AI-Family: Xilmi<br> Uses the same diplomacy-module and espionage-module as the base-AI to basically present an AI that diplomatically acts like base-AIs but still has all the advantages in the other aspects of the game.
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_HYBRID          | AI: Hybrid
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_CRUEL_HELP      | AI-Family: Xilmi (No relationship bar, no alliances)<br> ... these AIs all play more careful than aggressive while some racial differences still are applied. It's very similar in behavior to the latter but usually the games are a lot more peaceful as long as noone has a massive advantage. They are also highly opportunistic. The reason why "Fun" was created because playing against this kind of AI can be extremely frustrating. You can have a long game where nothing really happens and then be wiped out in a few turns from several opponents at once. There is an algorithm at play that guesses the chance of being backstabbed in the event of a war-declation. And because of that it is highly likely that the AI thinks the other party will be more likely to be backstabbed and not them, if they declare war. Oh... They will ignore everything in the case they should eventually reach the end of the tech-tree. So the game will not be technically endless, even if it seems like that.
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_CRUEL           | AI: Fusion
SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_FUN_HELP        | AI-Family: Xilmi (No relationship bar, no alliances)<br> Plays the game in a sort of "king-of-the-hill"-style. It's more concerned about preventing others from winning than it is concerned about winning itself. It will choose the strongest enemy available but takes into account when they are already at war. It creates some sort of tournament-like bracket-gameplay with separate 1v1s, that also can turn into 1vX for someone who's becoming too successfull. Note that once a war is declared they are not easily made to stop it. This prevents swingy-situations where it would become an eternal back-and-forth changing their current enemy with the situation. Basically: A former super-power being tackled from three sides will not simply be left alone when it's not a superpower anymore.

SETUP_OPPONENT_AI_PERSONALITY_HELP | AI-Family: Xilmi (No relationship bar, no alliances)<br> This one doesn't care about being fair when choosing their opponent. It is highly opportunistic and definitely wants to win. However, it's aggressiveness is heavily dependent on their empire's species and leader's personality. They can be anything from suicidal to overly careful. However, experience has shown that the more careful approach does a lot better on average. That's why...

SETTINGS_RANDOM_EVENTS_HELP       | There are twenty random events in Remnants of the Precursors <i> (sixten vanilla and four from the Modnar)</i>, some favorable and some unfavorable. As of turn 50 <i> (this value can be changed) </i>, the percentage chance that a random event will occur somewhere in the galaxy begins to climb. After a random event occurs, the percentage chance resets to zero and begins climbing again next turn.<br>Random events are a catch-up mechanic that favors weaker factions. Once the event is determined, it will target a player based on how well they're doing in the game. Favorable events are more likely to happen to players with lower overall production, whereas unfavorable events are more likely to happen to players with higher overall production. Some event can only happen once.
SETTINGS_RANDOM_EVENTS_DESC       | Space Monsters are random events and considerable mid-game threats.<br> Turn off space monsters or all random events.

SETTINGS_GALAXY_AGE_DESC          | Compared to normal galaxies, young galaxies have more white and blue stars while old galaxies have more red and neutron stars.
SETTINGS_TECH_TRADING_HELP        | Tech trading is the other common way to learn a technology. The AI factions will trade technologies with each other, so you might as well get in on the action.<br>You can turn off all technology trades or restrict these trades to allies.
SETTINGS_TECH_TRADING_DESC        | Turn off all technology trades or restrict these trades to allies.
SETTINGS_STAR_DENSITY_DESC        | Set to high to reduce the chance of empires being stranded early in the game.
SETTINGS_RESEARCH_RATE_HELP       | If you like savoring your new technologies, if you want to delay being distracted by science's newest shinies, you can slow the rate of research
SETTINGS_RESEARCH_RATE_DESC       | Slow the research rate of new technologies, lengthening the useful life of current technologies.<br> [Asymptotic in modnar MOD]
SETTINGS_NEBULAE_DESC             | Nebulae slow down ship travel and render shields useless. Increase or decrease their frequency.
// modnar: change PLANET_QUALITY settings, only Normal, Larger, and Richer
//SETTINGS_PLANET_QUALITY_DESC    | [modnar MOD: "Larger" gives +50% Planet Size, +20% Poor, -20% Rich;<br> "Richer" gives -20% Planet Size, -20% Poor, +50% Rich, +50% Artifact.]
SETTINGS_PLANET_QUALITY_HELP      |  Do you want your galaxy to lean more terran or more barren?<br>After the stars have been placed, each star has a percentage chance based on its type of getting a single planet. The star type then determines the environment of its planet. The environment sets the range of sizes available for a planet, with unfriendly environments tending to smaller planets. However, the formula allows planets to sometimes stray dramatically from their default ranges. It's possible, but unlikely, to find massive barren planets and tiny fertile planets. Finally, the star type determines the chance that its planet will have a special trait like poor, rich, or artifact.
SETTINGS_PLANET_QUALITY_DESC      | Increases or decreases the frequency of higher quality planets.
SETTINGS_TERRAFORMING_HELP        | When this is set to Normal, once you've colonized a Hostile planet with the required colony base, the only difference from non-Hostile planets is a 50% penalty to population growth. This can be removed with Atmospheric Terraforming, at which points the Hostile trait is removed and the colony is like any other environment. But if you'd like your Hostile planets to have more bite, put this setting on Reduced. Now the Improved Terraforming
technologies that increase the size of your planets will only have half effectiveness on Hostile planets. For instance, the first step of Improved Terraforming lets you add +10 to a planet's size to represent more hospitable conditions. But with this setting at Reduced, a Hostile planet will only get +5 size. And if you want really hostile Hostile planets, put this setting on None. Now you can't apply any terraforming size upgrades until you've applied Atmosphere Terraforming to remove the Hostile trait.
SETTINGS_TERRAFORMING_DESC        | Reduce or eliminate the benefits of the Improved Terraforming technologies on hostile planets.
SETTINGS_COLONIZING_HELP          |  By default, any special colony base can colonize a planet of that hostility or lower on the "hierarchy of hostilities" from Barren to Irradiated. But if you set this to Restricted, a Hostile environment will need a colony base of that specific type. Now the Irradiated Colony Base you'll need to settle the most hostile of planets is no longer the be-all and end-all of colony bases.
SETTINGS_COLONIZING_DESC          | Restrict the colonization of systems to only those for which you have acquired the specific technology.

SETTINGS_MOD_TRACK_UFOS_ACROSS_TURNS_HELP  | →SCANNER_2_NAME← or →SCANNER_3_NAME← can automatically determine ship destinations immediately. But even with the shorter ranges of →SCANNER_0_NAME← and →SCANNER_1_NAME←, often (slow) ships will be in range for two successive turns, so you can often determine ship trajectories anyway by squinting at a screenshot of last turn. This option just saves you the bother of squinting at last turn's screenshot. Two things to note. First, without →SCANNER_2_NAME←, the trajectories is displayed ending at the nearest star along the line. THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE SHIP WILL ACTUALLY STOP THERE (because you don't actually know that without →SCANNER_2_NAME←), only that the ship is moving in that direction. (Of course, for most galaxy shapes, close collinear stars are rare.) Second, while we want wonder whether scanners are "really" tracking ships continuously between turns, to allow this option to be enabled by default, this option will never give you any information you couldn't already have gotten by squinting at screenshots. That is, when there's a mess of ships of the same design close together such that you couldn't be completely sure which moved where by squinting at screenshots, no trajectories will be displayed.

SETTINGS_MOD_DARK_GALAXY_HELP            |<br><b>Why? by u/dweller_below</b><br><br><b>Boring:</b> We are all within a particulary thick nebula. The supernova that created this nebula spewed heavy elements EVERYWHERE. The particular combination of elements in our local nebula block EVERYTHING.<br><br><b>Funner/self referential:</b> We are participants in a vast simulation created by the Orions/Antarans. Naturally, the simulation must be good enough that we all express sentience/sapience. In iteration 42 of the simulation our Gods/Masters decided to isolate each race until we encounter each other.<br><br><b>Funnerest:</b> The Antarans won the Orion/Antaran war and moved to exterminate Exterminate EXTERMINATE EVERYTHING. Our races have all been recently rescued/moved/copied to our ARC (Antaran Rescue Craft) by the Orions. The ARC just looks like a small galaxy. The ARC is actually a pocket dimension/rescue craft. This explains several things:<br>- The high density of intelligent races within our ARC.<br>- Why the Orions don't dominate our ARC. The Orions oppose the Antarans. One of the differences is the Orions don't dominate/exterminate other races. This matches prior backstory.<br>- Why we haven't sensed radio emissions from each other. Or light from each other's star. Game starts at the creation of the ARC. We USED to see other stars. But, now everything is different. Now, when we start to move outside of our small ight bubbles, we find that everything is different. In fact, every star is radiating a decaying light bubble full of obsolete/meaningless information. But, as you get close to the adjacent stars, you can see what is really there NOW.<br>- Why physical law changes. The Orions manufactured different physical law within each game/ARC for "reasons". Everytime we play, the ARC can be slightly different. The Orions had enough resources to copy our races multiple times and create multiple ARCs. Each Game/ARC is an attempt to create a different combination of survivors.
