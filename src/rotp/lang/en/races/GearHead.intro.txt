The [race] League
The year is 10101...
The subjugation of all known Mythical Monsters has been completed. These Legendary Creatures have long been thought to be extraterrestrial and possibly extradimensional in origin.
Forcing Monsters with uncanny abilities to the yoke allow all manners of machinery to run at little expense. And with wealth being generated out of ether when certain Monsters clashed in duels, the League has never enjoyed such easy living.
Now with the secrets of interstellar travel extracted from the essence of warp-capable Beasts, the GearHeads set their sights to the untamed stars.
